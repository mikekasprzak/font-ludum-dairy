# Things still to do:
* Kerning
* Punctuation glyphs (`!.,#`)

# Inspirations
The modern Ludum Dare logo began by modifying glyphs from Null by FontFabric. I liked the weight of the font, and some of the thematic notes, specifically the curvyness. It reminded me of the old NASA and CN logos. I took the font in a more curvy direction, and only a handful of glyphs bare resemblence to the original inspiprations.

I've always been a fan of the original NASA logo. The _wormyness_ is a super interesting aesthetic to me. When I first discovered FontFabric's NULL font, I wanted a wormier version of that.

## CN Logo
